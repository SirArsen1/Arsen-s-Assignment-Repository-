Small help of ChatGPT was used during reviewing the code and finding minor problems, such as:
- Variable name being spelled wrong.
- The wrong order of functions in main function.

ChatGPT was giving other advices, but I ignored them, since I knew I how I wanted to write the code. For example it wanted to write a big chain of elif's in main loop, while I wanted to keep everything in respective functions, because I thought it looked much more cleaner.
